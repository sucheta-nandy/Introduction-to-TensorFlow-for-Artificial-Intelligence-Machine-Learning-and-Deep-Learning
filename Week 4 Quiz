1.Question 1
Using Image Generator, how do you label images?
It’s based on the directory the image is contained in

2.Question 2
What method on the Image Generator is used to normalize the image?
rescale

3.Question 3
How did we specify the training size for the images?
The target_size parameter on the training generator

4.Question 4
When we specify the input_shape to be (300, 300, 3), what does that mean?
Every Image will be 300x300 pixels, with 3 bytes to define color

5.Question 5
If your training data is close to 1.000 accuracy, but your validation data isn’t, what’s the risk here?
You’re overfitting on your training data

6.Question 6
Convolutional Neural Networks are better for classifying images like horses and humans because:
All of the above

7.Question 7
After reducing the size of the images, the training results were different. Why?
We removed some convolutions to handle the smaller images
