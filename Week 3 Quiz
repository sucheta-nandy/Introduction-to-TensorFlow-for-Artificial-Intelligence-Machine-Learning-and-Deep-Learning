1.Question 1
What is a Convolution?
A technique to isolate features in images

2.Question 2
What is a Pooling?
A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features

3.Question 3
How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
They isolate features in images

4.Question 4
After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?
26x26

5.Question 5
After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?
13x13

6.Question 6
Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:
It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
